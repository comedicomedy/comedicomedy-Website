      GNX is an album by the goat Kendrick Lamar released on November 22, 2024. This album consists of hype songs, melodics and storytelling tracks about his thoughts during the time of the beef and
      currently in 2024. This album has to be one of the best albums of 2024 under Chromakopia for me. "wacced out murals" telling his opinions on what happens during the beef and his opinions on Little Wayner
      and Snoop Dogg disrespecting him. "squabble up" being a hype anthem whose snippet appeared at the beginning of the "Not Like Us" music video and breaking my headphones. luther a melodic track featuring
      sza. "man at the garden" where he is expressing why he deserved his spot as the king of rap and his acheivements. hey now is another hype banger. reincarnated a storing telling track with
      a sample from a 2pac song which tells the stories of multiple black artists and himself. tv off is another hype banger with the famous lyric, "MUSTARD!" dodger blue his him showing love to his city and peekaboo on of my
      least favorite tracks on the album. That song was followed by "heart pt. 6" which tells his story with him and black hippie at the beginning and why it didn't work out because of him. gnx is another
     banger. And gloria is a song about his relationship with hip hop seen through the guise as if he was talking about his fiance. Overall this album is amazing and it sounds like you would bump it in a
     grand national. My favorite tracks are wacced out murals, reincarnated, and heart pt. 6.
