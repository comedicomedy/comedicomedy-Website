        May it Never Falter by glaive is his second studio album, his first being "i care so much that i don't care at all". I really like this album due to it's spacy production and how honest he
        sounds in the album. I might also be saying this because this one of my first hyperpop albums but I can say I'm interested in what comes out in the genre next. Some of my favorite tracks
        off this album are Freudian, EVERYDOG HAS ITS DAY, due to it's agressiveness, and For God and Country, due to how honest it sounds. Some things I didn't like on the album was the somewhat
        awkward delivery by kurtains on Live & Direct and some of the tracks repetivness. In Short, I think this album is pretty good. I also think I just have a soft spot for more introspective
        (or just sadder) albums.
